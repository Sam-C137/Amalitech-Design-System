# How to use `amalitech-star-rating`

The star rating commonly used to pick a range of values from a set of options. 
It is a simple way to gather feedback from users.

You could use it like this:

## Default

<Canvas of={StarStories.Default}/>

```html
    <amalitech-star-rating></amalitech-star-rating>
```

## Animated

The animated variant has a smooth transition into the DOM when it first renders.

<Canvas of={StarStories.Animated}/>

```html
    <amalitech-star-rating animated></amalitech-star-rating>
```

## Disabled

The disabled variant prevents the user from interacting with the star rating.

<Canvas of={StarStories.Disabled}/>

```html
    <amalitech-star-rating disabled></amalitech-star-rating>
```

## With Hover Disabled

When the `hover-disabled` attribute is set, the star rating will not respond to hover events.

<Canvas of={StarStories.HoverDisabled}/>

```html
    <amalitech-star-rating hover-disabled></amalitech-star-rating>
```

## Readonly

The readonly variant prevents the user from interacting with the star rating.

<Canvas of={StarStories.ReadOnly}/>

```html
    <amalitech-star-rating readonly value="4"></amalitech-star-rating>
```

## With a Custom Number of Stars

You can set the number of stars to be displayed by setting the `count` attribute.

<Canvas of={StarStories.WithCustomCount}/>

```html
    <amalitech-star-rating count="7"></amalitech-star-rating>
```

## With value

The component can be initialized with a value by setting the `value` attribute.

<Canvas of={StarStories.WithValue}/>

```html
    <amalitech-star-rating value="3"></amalitech-star-rating>
```

## With a Custom Stroke Color

You can set the color of the stroke by setting the `stroke-color` attribute. To change the 
fill color, use the `--star-rating-active` CSS variable.

<Canvas of={StarStories.WithCustomStrokeColor}/>

```html
    <amalitech-star-rating stroke-color="#ff0000"></amalitech-star-rating>
```

## Sizes 

The star rating component comes in  3 main sizes: small medium and large. You can chose a size by
setting the `size` attribute

### Small

<Canvas of={StarStories.Small}/>

```html
    <amalitech-star-rating size="small"></amalitech-star-rating>
```

### Large

<Canvas of={StarStories.Large}/>

```html
    <amalitech-star-rating size="large"></amalitech-star-rating>
```

## Listening for events

You can listen for the `amalitechRatingChange` event to get the value of the star rating when it changes.

```javascript
    const starRating = document.querySelector('amalitech-star-rating');
    /**
     * @returns {number} The value of the star rating
    */
    starRating.addEventListener('amalitechRatingChange', (event) => {
        console.log(event.detail);
    });
```

## Styling with CSS

Custom styling can be applied with exposed CSS variables

<head>
    amalitech-star-rating {
        --star-rating-active: red;
    }
</head>

```
