# Amalitech Design System

Welcome to Amalitech Pro's living Enterprise design system. Amalitech Pro Enterprise design system 
forms an underlying language that unites our visual style, components, and interaction patterns across 
design and code. The system provides a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, 
that can be assembled together to build any number of digital products.


## Ensuring Consistency in Code and Design

The Amalitech design system enables you to create products that align with our brand identity, contributing to the reinforcement of the Amalitech brand.

## Built-in Accessibility Features

ADS components are designed to meet the technical requirements for accessibility level AA, making them suitable for both customer-focused products and internal use cases.

## Designed to work seamlessly with popular frameworks and design tools

The UI libraries can be accessed in Figma. You have the option to utilize the code components either as standalone web components or within popular frameworks like Vue, React, and Angular.

## Ensuring an exceptional user experience

Amalitech Design System (ADS) streamlines the design and development process, saving time at every stage. From UI design and prototyping to design handover, front-end development, and 
brand approval, ADS allows more focus on creating unique features and functionality.

## Enhancing flexibility and scalability with design tokens

The inclusion of design tokens in Amalitech Design System makes it highly adaptable, allowing for quick implementation of changes and additions. It also enables the creation of themes for third-party brands in a timely manner.
